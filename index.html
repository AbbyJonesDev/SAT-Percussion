        There is something elemental about a beat.  It calls to us on a subconscious level.  Our feet start tapping.  Our heads nod in time to the music.  And long after the rhythm fades away, we carry it with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We tap it out on the table, on a book, on our lap - on any surface available.  The beat won’t stay inside.  We change it up as we go, make it our own, make it suit our mood.  We pass it on to those around us.  They may or may not appreciate it.  (Teachers, in particular, hear more tapping than they can take in a normal day.)
      </p>

        Some of us resonate to the beat more than others.  My mom tells the story of going to a concert when she was pregnant with me; my tiny feet began kicking in time to the music.  As a teenager, my dad would often tease me about “playing my sandwich” while we were eating.  Without realizing it, I was tapping a rhythm on the bread between bites.  Working at McDonald’s gave me time to hone my percussion skills by beating on the counter between taking orders in the drive through; the ice bucket made a great percussion instrument, too.

        I was in seventh heaven when I discovered the djembe in college.  Learning to play it was like finding my way home.

        The djembe is my favorite hand percussion instrument, but there are amazing hand drums from all over the world.
